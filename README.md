## ðŸ§  How It Works
App.jsx
Main component that wires everything together:

Handles uploaded HTML state

Passes content to Header and Content

Triggers HTML download

## Content.jsx
Renders the content area and scrollable sidebar:

Loads .docx-converted HTML or manual.html

Builds a sidebar from all <h1> elements

Handles scrollspy + smooth section jumping

## Header.jsx
Contains UI buttons:

Import DOCX: Triggers file upload and converts to HTML using Mammoth

Download HTML: Saves the rendered HTML as a .html file

convert-docx-to-html.js
Optional Node.js script to pre-convert .docx to HTML:

bash```
Copy
Edit
node convert-docx-to-html.js
It reads manual.docx and saves the HTML to public/manual.html.
```
